# work-time-counter

## Description
Work time counter app with Python and Tkinter as GUI library. Used 
for real-world problem of keeping track of time spent at work and 
at specific tasks. 

## Functional requirements
- Pressing start/continue button begins counting and displaying time elapsed. 
- Pressing pause/reset button pauses time counting. 
- Pressing start/continue button again continues the counting from where it was left. 
- Pressing pause/reset button again while paused resets the counter from zero, 
which represents that your "work day is over". 
- User can write at any point their current task and when pressing OK button, 
they change the message to the log. 
- Log is displayed (if possible) and saved into a log file with the name of current 
day and user set name, like a work profile (if possible). 
- Log is saved automatically into a file every time it's updated. 

## Not required functionality

## Limitations (if possible)
